# PobladosGAN

This degree project in Systems and Computing Engineering comprehensively addresses the complete cycle of modeling and generation of satellite images, focused on Colombian geography. It begins with the meticulous collection and preparation of vectorized geographic data, followed by the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This approach allows for accurate and efficient synthesis of satellite images from the collected data. The adopted methodology ensures rigor at each stage of the process, from the initial analysis of the data to the deployment of the final model. The project stands out for its practical and technical approach, offering a valuable tool for geographic analysis and territorial planning in Colombia, and demonstrates an effective application of advanced AI technologies to solve specific challenges in the field of geoinformatics.
